              - Created QueryPage Class
              - Created methods to:
                - List the most expensive items in each category, 
                - List the users who posted at least two items that were posted on the same day, one has a category
                  of X, and another has a category of Y,
                - List all the items posted by user X, such that all the comments are "Excellent" or "good" for
                  these items
                - List a user pair (A, B) such that they always gave each other "excellent" reviews for every single
                  item they posted.

              - Created methods to:  
                - Display all the users who never posted any "excellent" items: an item is excellent if at least
                  three reviews are excellent.
                - Display all the users who never posted a "poor" review.
                - Display all the users who posted some reviews, but each of them is "poor".
                - Display those users such that each item they posted so far never received any "poor" reviews.     
              - Recorded and Uploaded Video Demo
