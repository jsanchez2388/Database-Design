                - List the users who posted at least two items that were posted on the same day, one has a category
                  of X, and another has a category of Y,
                - List all the items posted by user X, such that all the comments are "Excellent" or "good" for
                  these items
                - List a user pair (A, B) such that they always gave each other "excellent" reviews for every single
